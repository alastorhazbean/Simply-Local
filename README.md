# Simply-Local
Simply local is a Simply Plural "Client" that can be put onto any device that can run javascript and render html / css.
Simply local can also be used to get around schools banning the web based version of simply plural.
And as the name implies if not already in the first version there will be functions added to save member data locally so even if your offline you can still use everything!

## Current features

- Seeing members.
  Currently in the quickapi.js file there are functions to get member data

## Planned features

- Setting front data
  i plan to add the ability to set the current fronters and see them.
- more to be thought of but i plan to port over as many app features as i physically can and add more. (paid simply plural features may be added to this but also not)
